 agot_bm_7899_desc:0 "The Valyrian Freehold has fallen, collapsing when the peninsula was destroyed in the Doom. Within mere hours, Valyria was gone and the Freehold was destroyed. House Targaryen had relocated to Dragonstone, the westernmost outpost of Valyria located in the narrow sea, thereby ensuring their survival.\n\nSome other dragonlords — those who had not been in Valyria when the Doom occurred — survived as well. In Tyrosh, Lys and Qohor, it is said that dragonlords were spared the destruction and were now unsure of what their futures held. #bold \n\nAurion Varezys, a dragonlord who had been visiting Qohor, proclaimed himself the first Emperor of Valyria and raised forces from the Qohorik.

In response to this, Aenar sold his holdings in the Valyrian Freehold and the Lands of the Long Summer, and moved with his family and dragons to Dragonstone, the westernmost outpost of the Valyrian Freehold. The Targaryens were far from the most powerful of the dragonlords, and their rivals in Valyria saw their flight as an act of cowardice. However, because Aenar had moved his family away from Valyria, the Targaryens were the strongest of the dragonlords to survive the Doom"
